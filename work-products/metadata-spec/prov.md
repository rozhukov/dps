### Abstract
**Editor's Note:**
we need to put text here

Best practices: 

- Expect this text to be reused in multiple other places to explain the specification in summary form.  
- This is not the TC or OP scope (which is an IPR and rules boundary);  rather, this section is the summary intended purpose of this specification.  
- Short is better; four paragraphs or less is recommended.  
- If use of this spec is deliberately created to rely on or complement another standard, consider briefly mentioning that here as context.  
- To the extent that discussion of the larger context of the spec, or its history, or the circumstances that led to its creation or revision, are necessary, they belong in the Introduction, not here.

# 5 Provenance Information Model
The information model of the provenance metadata is described in human-readable property tables.
The technical encoding may be found in section 6.

The Data Provenance Standards are made up of three groups of metadata elements: 
Source, Provenance, and Use.

![Metadata](./images//metadata.svg)

The property tables first define metadata about the specification itself,
then describe how a record is made of the 3 primary metadata elements
(Source, Provenance, and Use), then describe each of the 3 elements.
Subsequent tables describe the underlying fields of the 3 elements.

## 5.1 Primary Metadata Elements

# 8 Safety, Security, and Data Protection Considerations


\< 


This section is **REQUIRED** and **MUST** be the second to last numbered section in the document, right before Conformance. This section contains information about safety, security, data protection, and privacy considerations. These can be divided up into separate subsections as desired. All documents **SHOULD** have at least a security and data protection considerations section, and otherwise **MUST** have a blank section indicating “None.” Any other considerations **MAY** also be added.


Please note that any specification that will need to register something with IANA or has plans to go on to ITU/ISO/IEC **MUST** have this section filled out. For an example please see the following section in the CACAO specification here [https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v2.0/cs01/security-playbooks-v2.0-cs01.html\#\_Toc152256574](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v2.0/cs01/security-playbooks-v2.0-cs01.html#_Toc152256574)
